# LineIntersections
This contains the solution to a line intersection problem. We are given a list of points on two parallel lines that are connected to each other, We want to determine how many of these lines are crossing.
Input should be read in from stdin. The first line will be the number of instances. For each instance,
the first line will contain the number of pairs of points (n). The next n lines each contain the location x
of a point qi on the top line. Followed by the final n lines of the instance each containing the location x
of the corresponding point pi on the bottom line
